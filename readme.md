# Movies Project

This project will create a web page that contains a list of the top 100 best movies according to IMDB rating, you can find this database here: [Top 100 rated movies](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hjorturlarsen/IMDB-top-100/master/data/movies.json)

The purpose of this proyect is to implement what I've learned so far in [Make it Real](https://makeitreal.camp/) about data base handling, forms and authentication.
